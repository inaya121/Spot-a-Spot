# Spot-a-Spot
An efficient parking lot navigation system

This project was created to improve the efficiency of parking in malls and large parking lots.

How it works:
  - Ultrasonic sensors are added to parking spots to check its parking status
  - A website is created which contains the parking status of each spot
  - The website is made accessible at the entrance to the parking lot using a QR code
